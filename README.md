# Simpsons Quotes API

This project is a simple API for listing quotes from *The Simpsons*.

## Features
- Built with **Node.js**.
- Uses **MySQL** and **MySQL Workbench** for database management.
- Environment variables are managed with a `.env` file.
- Tested using **Postman**.

## Database
The database consists of three main tables:
- `characters`
- `quotes`
- `episodes`

These are connected through a relation table that links the `id` of each.

**May the force of Springfield be with you!** 🍩 💛
